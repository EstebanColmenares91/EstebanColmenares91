### About me

------------

I'm from Venezuela ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª. I'm studying the 10th quarter of Software Engineering at the university Rafael Belloso Chacin. I'm a person who always wants to learn new things, especially JavaScript and its ecosystem, music, and languages. I'm a self-taught person with a high curiosity to solve any problem. However, I like to discuss with people when I have doubts with any information or some error.

Making apps with JavaScript feels nice and comfortable. Also, I always look for good practices and sorted code.

As I wrote a few lines back, I love languages so much that I speak Spanish, English, and French but I'm looking for a new language and It could be Italian or German.ðŸ¤” 

Hobbies: 
- Doing sportsâš½.
- Playing video games ðŸŽ®.
- Watch some anime and series. 
- Listen to music and I hope one day to play the guitarðŸŽµðŸŽ¸.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

- ReactJS

### Little description of my experience
-----------------
Since 2021 I have been studying HTML5 and CSS3 and at the beginning of 2022 I started JavaScript with stuff like variables, closures, scopes, async n' await, and how v8 works and I practiced all those concepts with the projects starting with HTML5 and CSS3 only. And step by step I added JS to those projects with DOM manipulation and fetching APIs. Those projects you could see them here: https://github.com/EstebanColmenares91?tab=repositories.

In July 2022 I participated in an inventory system working on the UX/UI then I applied HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
