#### About me

------------

I'm from Venezuela ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª. I'm studying 10th quarter of Software Enginner at the university. I never stop learning Javascript's ecosystem and everything about front-end development. Also, making some apps with JS feels really nice and comfortable, always looking for good practices and a sorted code.

I love languages so much so that I speak Spanish, English and French (still studying).

Outside coding I love to do sportsâš½, play videogamesðŸŽ®, watch some anime and series. Also, I love music and I hope one day play the guitar.ðŸŽµðŸŽ¸

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

- ReactJS

Little description of my experience
-----------------
Along this year I've studied JavaScript hardly from the beginning stuff like variables, closures, scopes, async n' await and I practiced all those concepts with the projets from only HTML and CSS. And step by step I added JS to those projects with DOM manipulation and fetching APIs. Those projects you could see them here: https://github.com/EstebanColmenares91?tab=repositories.
